## 1. Introduction

This project is a telemedicine application whose purpose is the supervision from the patientâ€™s home of a chronic disease, in our case Epilepsy.

The application works recieving data from a BITalino and sending it to a MySQL data base by a connection stablished with a Rest API ([Link to the Rest API used in the project, click on me](https://github.com/MiguelOteo/TelemedicineRestAPI)), as well as allowing the user to create two possible accounts, patients which send the BITalino bio-data and doctors who can see the stored patient's data.

It is important to emphasize that this project works together with TelemedicineRestAPI project, which link has been written previously.
