## 1. Introduction

This project is a telemedicine application whose purpose is the supervision from the patientâ€™s home of a chronic disease, in our case Epilepsy.

The application works recieving data from a BITalino and sending it to a MySQL data base by a connection stablished with a Rest API ([Link to the Rest API used in the project, click on me](https://github.com/MiguelOteo/TelemedicineRestAPI)), as well as allowing the user to create two possible accounts, patients which send the BITalino bio-data and doctors who can see the stored patient's data.

It is important to emphasize that this project works together with TelemedicineRestAPI project, which link has been written previously.

 6.1 Switch on the board.
 6.2 Enter into the BITalino Connection in Telelepsia Application.
 6.3 Wait 10 seconds while the program search BITalinos around you.
